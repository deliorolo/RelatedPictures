        <p>▶ This game was created to be played by two teams (blue and green) of minimum two elements each (minimum four
            players).</p>
        <p>▶ An element from each team (two people) are able to unveil the colors that belong to each image without the
            knowledge of other players.</p>
        <p>▶ From the total of twenty pictures, there are eight for one team, seven for the other, four neutral (yellow)
            and one game killer (red).</p>
        <p>▶ The team with more initial pictures always starts the game.</p>
        <p>▶ The element aware of the colors is going to tell a
            single word that can be related with the biggest number of their pictures.</p>
        <p>▶ The other elements from the team are going to guess a picture through the given word. In case the selected
            picture is a match, they can keep the turn and select the next one.</p>
        <p>▶ In case the team selects a picture from the other team or a neutral, the turn changes and the same
            procedure is repeated by the other team.</p>
        <p>▶ Everytime the turn changes, a new word is given. When one team finds all the pictures that belong to them,
            the game is over and this team is the winner.</p>
        <p>▶ If any team, any time, selects the red picture the game is immediately over and the opponents are the
            winners.</p>
